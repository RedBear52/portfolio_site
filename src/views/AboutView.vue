      <h1>Howdy!</h1>
      <br />
      <p>
        A few years ago, I started learning to code. This exploration opened up
        an entirely new universe of practical & creative expression in my life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For 25 years I've worked as an independent music professional (recording
        artist, performer, instructor, promoter, writer and radio DJ). This
        experience taught me a lot about communication, connection and the
        dogged persistence required to turn ideas into living/breathing things.

        Outside of work and tech, I'm a volunteer youth wrestling coach who
        likes to camp, kayak, cycle and grapple.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I live to learn through play and I love to build clean/functional apps
        that feel good to use.
